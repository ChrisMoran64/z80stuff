# z80stuff
An eclectic bucket of Z80 code.

I have a fascination for old computer systems, and I am in the process of resurrecting a Z80 machine that I built back in the 1980's

So my journey has led me to lots of code, which I am cleaning up, and figure if I need it, someone else might too.

Enjoy!
