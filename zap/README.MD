This code is reproduced from the book

"Build your own Z80 Computer", By Steve Ciarcia

Originally published by Byte Books.

It was released as a public electronic copy by Circuit Cellar Ink Magazine.  Contact circuitcellar@circuitcellar.com for clarification

I have had to type this by hand, and made every effort to reproduce the code exactly as published.  The only changes were to suit the Savannah Z80 Assembler (z80asm).  Spelling issues were deliberately left IN the code.
